# PRODIGY_CS_03
Password Strength Checker
This project is part of the **Prodigy InfoTech Cybersecurity Internship** Task 03.
## Objective
To build a simple Python tool that checks whether a password is **Weak**, **Moderate**, or **Strong**, and provides useful suggestions to help users improve insecure passwords.
Unlike other tools, this version avoids technical scores and focuses on user-friendly feedback.
## Features
- Classifies password as: **Strong password **, **Moderate password**, or **Weak password**
- Provides specific suggestions if the password is not strong
- Detects usage of weak/common patterns like "1234", "qwerty", "password"
- Easy to run from the terminal (no GUI required)
## What Makes a Password Strong?
A password is considered **strong** if it:
- Has at least 8 characters
- Contains both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Includes at least one digit
- Includes a special character (like `@`, `#`, `!`, etc.)
- Avoids common patterns like `1234`, `password`, `qwerty`
